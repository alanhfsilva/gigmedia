# Assignement for GiG Media | Alan Silva

This is the first part of the test to organize the ideas. These are the steps I'm planning to take:
1. Create a container to help with the setup of the environment
1. Configure the environment requirements: PHP 8, Composer 2, and MySQL 5.7
1. Create a Laravel 8 project
1. Set up the database tables (via migrations)
1. Create the API and routes
1. Create test for the API
1. Create a seeder (in case I have time to)
